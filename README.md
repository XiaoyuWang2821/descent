# Descent

**Descent is just getting started and is under active development. Please check back soon for more updates!**

Descent is a package for performing first-order optimization. It is just getting of the ground, check back soon for more updates.

It contains routines for running a number of different optimization algorithms, given a function that computes the gradient of the objective you wish to optimize.

It also contains a bunch of useful helper files for converting parameter structures (lists or dictionaries) into arrays and back.

# Algorithms

## Implemented
- Gradient descent `gd`
- Accelerated Gradient descent `agd`

## Todo
- Stochastic gradient descent `sgd`
- Stochastic average gradient `sag`
- RMSprop `rmsprop`

# Features (coming soon)

- Logging and display updates each iteration
- Visualization (post-optimization)
